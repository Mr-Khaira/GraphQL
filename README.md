# GraphQL

Learning graphQL completely.

So in a noral REST api, we create separate endpoints to fetch different resources,
but what if we do not want the whole thing and just want a part of that data ?
AKA partial fetch, then might need to crate multiple endpoints, but that would
be a lot of code.

GraphQL solves this problem, it has just 1 endpoint('graphql'), and it returns
only want we ask for.
